    <p>
        I hope to become a pro at ASP.net! I haven't had too much practice in
        html or javascript yet, and so I hope throughout this semester I can
        pick up some skills there as well and become much better at programming.
        This semester, I'm pretty much in charge of my own learning outside of
        class, and I plan to make the most of it!
